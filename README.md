# NoobWeather

iOS app for checking the current weather based on the user's location

## Purpose
I built this to better understand networking in Swift and parsing of JSON data. I chose to use Swift's [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) class instead of a third party library (like [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)) to avoid unnecessary dependencies. 

## Built using:
* Swift 4.2
* [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api/)
